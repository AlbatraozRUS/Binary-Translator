# Binary-Translator
Binary translator from own version of ASM to LLVM IR.

# CPU-Simulator
This project is a new version of the [previous processor emulator](https://github.com/AlbatraozRUS/Soft_Processor), made in the 1st year as part of the course of I.R.Dedinsky.
It corrected the shortcomings of the previous version, and also it was rewritten for the C ++ language.
The "Assembler" folder contains the compiler from our version of the assembler into its own byte code (architecture of x86-64 was taken as the basis).
The Simulator folder contains the emulator itself.
For example, there is a program that calculates the factorial of a number (factorial.txt).
